    Recursive implementation of DFS algorithm on a graph.

    Depth First Search Overview:
    ------------------------
    Used to traverse trees, tree structures or graphs.
    Starts at a selected node (root) and explores the branch
    as far as possible before backtracking.

    Time Complexity: O(E + V)
        E = Number of edges
        V = Number of vertices (nodes)
